# Adavanced-Digital-Logic-Design

This Repository is work of 1.5 years in Digital VLSI Domain. The Folders has all the main verilog files of the RTL design.

# DADDA Multiplier
 This section of the Repository has the RTL design of 8X8 and 16X16 bit multiplier. This work is taken to work backend where cadence tool genus is used to synthesize the desgin to generate syhtesis report. Area, power and delay is studies for the multiplier and obatined the efficient power for the design compared to previous work. The same technical Research paper is written and presented at ICTCS conference. The link of the paper will be provide once it is available online.
